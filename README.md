## System Architecture

Nova follows a modern, cloud-native architecture designed for scalability, performance, and reliability. The system is built using a microservices approach with clear separation between frontend, backend, and data layers.

### Architecture Overview

The application architecture consists of six main components working together to deliver a seamless user experience:

**1. Front-End Deployment Layer**
- **Vercel**: Primary hosting platform for the React application, providing global CDN, automatic deployments, and serverless functions
- **Cloudflare**: Additional security layer offering DDoS protection, web application firewall (WAF), and performance optimization
- **Google Analytics**: User behavior tracking and application usage insights

**2. Front-End Technology Stack**
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development ensuring code reliability and maintainability
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast build tool and development server for optimal developer experience
- **React**: Component-based UI framework for building interactive user interfaces
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid, consistent styling

**3. Authentication & External APIs**
- **Firebase SSO**: Secure authentication service supporting multiple login methods (Google, email/password)
- **Firebase SDK**: Client-side integration for real-time features and user management
- **Groq AI API**: Advanced AI capabilities for content summarization, chat assistance, and smart study recommendations
- **Google API Services**: Integration with Google Calendar, Classroom, and other productivity tools

**4. Back-End Technology Stack**
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side application logic
- **Express.js**: Minimalist web framework for building robust APIs and handling HTTP requests
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database toolkit for seamless database operations and migrations
- **WebSocket**: Real-time bidirectional communication for live updates and collaborative features

**5. Back-End Deployment Infrastructure**
- **Render**: Cloud platform hosting the Node.js backend with automatic scaling and deployment
- **Vercel Edge Network**: Global content delivery network ensuring low-latency API responses worldwide

**6. Database Layer**
- **Oracle Cloud Database**: Primary production database offering enterprise-grade reliability, security, and performance
- **PostgreSQL**: Development and backup database solution providing flexibility and local development support

### Data Flow Architecture

The system follows a unidirectional data flow pattern:

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the React frontend hosted on Vercel
2. **Authentication**: Firebase handles user authentication and session management
3. **API Communication**: Frontend communicates with the Express.js backend via RESTful APIs
4. **External Services**: Backend integrates with AI services (Groq) and Google APIs for enhanced functionality
5. **Data Persistence**: All application data is stored in Oracle Cloud Database with PostgreSQL as fallback
6. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections enable live collaboration and instant notifications

### Infrastructure Benefits

**Scalability**: The architecture can handle growing user loads through cloud-native scaling
**Performance**: Global CDN and edge computing ensure fast response times worldwide  
**Reliability**: Multiple database options and cloud providers minimize downtime risk
**Security**: Multi-layered security with Cloudflare protection and Firebase authentication
**Developer Experience**: Modern tooling and TypeScript ensure maintainable, bug-free code
**Cost Efficiency**: Optimized use of free tiers and pay-as-you-scale pricing models
