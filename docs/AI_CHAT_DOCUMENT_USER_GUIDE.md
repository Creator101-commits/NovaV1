### 🎯 Specific Requests
Instead of: "Make flashcards"
Try: "Create 10 flashcards covering the main concepts in chapters 1-3"

### 🔍 Focused Exploration
Instead of: "Explain everything"
Try: "Explain the methodology section and why this approach was chosen"

### 📚 Study Material Generation
Instead of: "Help me study"
Try: "Create a study guide with key definitions, formulas, and practice problems"

👤 User: What are the main topics covered?

🤖 AI: Based on the lecture notes, the main topics covered are:

       1. **Wave-Particle Duality**
          - De Broglie wavelength
          - Double-slit experiment
          - Complementarity principle
       
       2. **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**
          - Position-momentum uncertainty

          - Solutions for simple systems
       
       Would you like me to explain any of these in more detail?

👤 User: Create flashcards for the first topic

🤖 AI: **Flashcard Set: Wave-Particle Duality**

       **Card 1:**
       Q: What is wave-particle duality?
       A: The concept that matter and energy exhibit both 
          wave-like and particle-like properties depending 
          on the experimental setup.
       
       **Card 2:**
       Q: What is the de Broglie wavelength formula?
       A: λ = h/p, where λ is wavelength, h is Planck's 
          constant, and p is momentum.
       
       **Card 3:**
       Q: What does the double-slit experiment demonstrate?
       A: It demonstrates wave-particle duality by showing 
          that particles create an interference pattern 
          (wave behavior) when not observed, but behave 
          as particles when measured.
